The dataset includes 34 images.
Banana are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
